![Per Engzell](portrait.jpg){:style="float:right; margin:15px; width: 40%;"}

I am an Associate Professor of Sociology at [UCL Social Research Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-and-centres/departments/ucl-social-research-institute), University College London and the [Swedish Institute for Social Research](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/), Stockholm University. I am also an Associate Member of [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. 

I work on social stratification and mobility, where my current interests span long-run trends in intergenerational mobility, worker-employer dynamics, and disequalizing consequences of disruptive events. I am also committed to advancing transparency in social science. 

My research has been featured in the *New York Times*, *Washington Post*, *Financial Times*, *The Economist*, and on podcasts such as *The Weeds*. My research on school closures during COVID-19 influenced policy in several countries, was presented at the World Bank, the OECD, and the European Commission, and received the National Academy of Sciences [Cozzarelli Prize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhuv1yJrdC4).
