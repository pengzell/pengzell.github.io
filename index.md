![Per Engzell](portrait.jpg){:style="float:right; margin:15px; width: 40%;"}

I am Associate Professor of Sociology at [UCL Social Research Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-and-centres/departments/ucl-social-research-institute), University College London, and Associate Member of [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. My research deals with educational inequalities and intergenerational mobility. Some ongoing projects concern social mobility from preindustrial times until today, the role of employers in intergenerational earnings transmission, and model robustness in social science.
 
My research has been featured in the *New York Times*, *Washington Post*, *Financial Times*, *The Economist*, and podcasts such as *The Weeds* and *PNAS Science Sessions*. Recent work I did on school closures during COVID-19 had a documented impact on policy in several countries, invited talks at the European Commission, the OECD, and the World Bank, and was awarded with the National Academy of Sciences [Cozzarelli Prize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhuv1yJrdC4).
