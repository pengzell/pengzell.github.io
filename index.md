Prize Research Fellow in Sociology at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford.

[My research](https://pengzell.github.io/inprogress/) focuses on intergenerational socioeconomic mobility and its variation across place and time. In my work, I draw on novel data including historical Censuses and genetically informed designs. 

I received my PhD from Stockholm University and hold  affiliations with the [Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science](http://www.demographicscience.ox.ac.uk), Oxford, and the [Swedish Institute for Social Research](https://www.sofi.su.se/english/), Stockholm.
