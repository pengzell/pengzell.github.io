![Per Engzell](portrait.jpg){:style="float:right; margin:15px; width: 40%;"}

I am an Associate Professor of Sociology at [UCL Social Research Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/departments-and-centres/departments/ucl-social-research-institute), University College London, and [Swedish Institute for Social Research (SOFI), Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/swedish-institute-for-social-research/). I am also an Associate Member of [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. 

My research is in social stratification and mobility, currently focusing on three main streams. First, I am interested in dynamics between workers and employers, and how they shape processes of intergenerational mobility in the labor market. Second, I study the evolution of intergenerational mobility in the long run, from preindustrial times until today. Third, I investigate unanticipated disruptions to education, their consequences for inequality, and how to mitigate them. Beyond my substantive research, I have a strong interest in methods and advancing transparency in social science. 

My research has been featured in the *New York Times*, *Washington Post*, *Financial Times*, *The Economist*, and on podcasts such as *The Weeds*. Work I did on school closures during COVID-19 had a documented impact on policy in several countries, was presented at the World Bank, the OECD, and the European Commission, and received a [Cozzarelli Prize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhuv1yJrdC4) from the US National Academy of Sciences for outstanding scientific excellence and originality.
