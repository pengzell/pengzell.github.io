![Per Engzell](portrait.jpg){:style="float:right; margin:15px; width: 40%;"}

I am a sociologist and Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science](http://www.demographicscience.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. Previously I held the Prize Research Fellowship at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford, and completed my doctorate at the [Swedish Institute for Social Research](https://www.sofi.su.se/english/), and I remain affiliated with both institutions.

My research focuses on intergenerational mobility and how culture, technology, and institutions interact to shape economic prospects in the long run. I am particularly interested in novel sources of "big" data, including digitized historical Censuses and modern-day administrative registers. Methodologically, I take an active interest in interdisciplinarity and open science.
