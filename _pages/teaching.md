My lecture slides for Intermediate Quantitative Methods at University of Oxford's Graduate Program in Sociology are available here: *[Preliminaries](https://github.com/pengzell/pengzell.github.io/blob/master/_content/IQM_Prelims.pdf), [Missing data](https://github.com/pengzell/pengzell.github.io/blob/master/_content/IQM_Missing.pdf), [Measurement error](https://github.com/pengzell/pengzell.github.io/blob/master/_content/IQM_Errors.pdf), [Instrumental variables](https://github.com/pengzell/pengzell.github.io/blob/master/_content/IQM_IV.pdf), [Multiple comparison](https://github.com/pengzell/pengzell.github.io/blob/master/_content/IQM_Comparison.pdf), [Regression artefacts](https://github.com/pengzell/pengzell.github.io/blob/master/_content/IQM_Artefacts.pdf).*

In addition to teaching at graduate and undergraduate levels, I also have experience in thesis supervision at these levels from Oxford and from Stockholm University.
