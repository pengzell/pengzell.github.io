Divergence of Income Mobility and Perceived Living Standards in the US since 1940 (with Thor Berger)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In just a few decades, Americans have seen a drastic decline in upward income mobility. Among baby boomers, 90% earned a higher real income than their parents; in recent cohorts, only half do. At the same time, secular trends raised living standards across a wide range of domains: improved health and lifespans, fading discrimination, cleaner air and water, increased safety from crime, and new digital goods and services. Against this background, we ask whether a growing share of Americans actually perceive that their living standards have declined relative to their parents. In contrast to income mobility, perceived mobility in  living standards remains stable and high, a divergence arguably attributable to improvements in quality of life. Social scientists and policy makers would benefit from a wider range of data to track the experience of successive generations.
