*Intergenerational Mobility in the Fourth Industrial Revolution* (with Thor Berger)

The maturation of industrial society has long been seen as an engine of occupational upgrading and opportunity. Following the rise of the factory, the assembly line, and the office computer, some claim that we are now entering a fourth industrial revolution where autonomous systems are transforming the nature of work. What are the consequences of this transformation for intergenerational income mobility? Examining variation across 722 U.S. labor markets, we find that intergenerational persistence is higher in areas heavily exposed to industrial automation. These effects are rooted in childhood experiences and concentrated among men from disadvantaged homes. Unequal labor relations appear to exacerbate the association, while affordable access to college ameliorates it. The received view of industrial change as an engine of mobility should be revised to consider the institutional context of automation.

*Objective and Perceived Intergenerational Mobility Since 1940* (with Thor Berger)

<summary>Read more</summary>
In just a few decades, Americans have seen a drastic decline in upward income mobility. Among baby boomers, 90% earned a higher real income than their parents; in recent cohorts, only half do. At the same time, secular trends raised living standards across a wide range of domains: improved health and lifespans, fading discrimination, cleaner air and water, increased safety from crime, and new digital goods and services. Against this background, we ask whether a growing share of Americans actually perceive that their living standards have declined relative to their parents. In contrast to income mobility, perceived mobility in living standards remains stable and high, a divergence arguably attributable to improvements in quality of life. Social scientists and policy makers would benefit from a wider range of data to track the experience of successive generations.

*Intergenerational Mobility in Sweden Before the Welfare State* (with Thor Berger, Björn Eriksson, Jakob Molinder)
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
This paper analyzes intergenerational mobility in Sweden prior to the emergence of the welfare state. We analyse occupational mobility using full-count census data that allow us to link sons observed in 1910 to their fathers in 1880. Results reveal that Sweden was more mobile than other European countries such as Norway or Britain at the time – indeed, several Swedish regions show similar rates of mobility as the New World economies of US and Argentina. We provide suggestive evidence that the relatively high level of mobility is explained by Sweden's exceptionally rapid economic growth and high levels of geographic mobility prior to the outbreak of World War I. Thus, economic fundamentals may be more important than structural differences in explaining historical mobility differences between the Old and New World.

*How Robust are Intergenerational Income Correlations?* (with Carina Mood)
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Recent work highlights how "researcher degrees of freedom" – undisclosed flexibility in research design – can give rise to varying results. The study of income mobility is no exception, with decisions ranging over income concept, unit of observation, functional form, treatment of outliers, etc. Using Swedish data on the population of children born 1958–1972, we exhaust a model space of several hundred thousands specifications to answer three questions. What is the range of reasonable estimates? Which specification fits data best? How sensitive are estimated trends? Linear correlations fit better than rank correlations, while log-log correlations (and hence, elasticities) fit poorly and behave erratically over time. Even with more robust measures of association, different income definitions follow opposing trends: increasing persistence in family income and women's earnings, flat or decreasing in men's earnings.

*Is Immigrant Optimism Contagious? Spillovers of Immigrant Friends in School* (with Are Skeie Hermansen)
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Is academic achievement affected by the presence of immigrant peers? Previous work mostly suggests no but, we argue, has been misguided on two accounts. First, it focused on aggregate social settings such as schools, while social interactions unfold in more intimate settings. Secondly, it assumed that immigrant peers would harm performance, ignoring their often high aspirations. We use a combination of administrative and sociometric network data from Sweden, and develop methods that let us estimate causal effects of immigrant peers at the level of (i) schools, (ii) classrooms, and (iii) friendship networks. We find little influence at the aggregate level but a strong and positive impact of immigrant peers in the same classroom and of immigrant friends. Existing studies may have mistaken both the sign and the magnitude of immigrant influence.
