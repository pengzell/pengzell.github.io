*A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Learning* (with Bastian Betthäuser and Anders Malthe Bach-Mortensen) | [working paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g2wuy)
<details>

How has the COVID-19 pandemic affected learning progress among school-age children? Two years after the onset of the pandemic, a growing number of studies have addressed this question, but findings vary depending on context. We conduct a pre-registered systematic review, quality appraisal and meta-analysis of 34 studies across 12 countries to assess the magnitude of the effect of the pandemic on learning and the role of different factors in moderating this effect. We find a significant overall learning deficit early in the pandemic (Cohen’s d = -0.17, 95 c.i. [-0.22, -0.13]), which persists over time. Forgone learning was particularly large among children from low socio-economic backgrounds and in contexts with high excess mortality, longer school closures, and less-developed digital learning infrastructures. Future research should assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries, as existing studies mainly focus on high-income countries.

*Firms and the Intergenerational Transmission of Labor Market Advantage* (with Nathan Wilmers) | [working paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mv3e9)
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Recent research finds that pay inequality stems both from firm pay-setting and from workers’ individual characteristics. Yet, intergenerational mobility research remains focused on transmission of individual traits, and has failed to test how firms shape the inheritance of inequality. We study this question using three decades of Swedish population register data, and decompose the intergenerational earnings correlation into firm pay premiums and stable worker effects. One quarter of the intergenerational earnings correlation at midlife is explained by sorting between firms with unequal pay. Employer or industry inheritance account for a surprisingly small share of this firm-based earnings transmission. Instead, children from high-income backgrounds benefit from matching with high-paying firms irrespective of the sources of parents’ earnings advantage. Our analysis reveals how an imperfectly competitive labor market provides an opening for skill-based rewards in one generation to become class-based advantages in the next.

*How Robust are Estimates of Intergenerational Income Mobility?* (with Carina Mood) | [working paper](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gd2t6)
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Rising inequalities in rich countries have led to concerns that the economic ladder is getting harder to climb. It is well established that intergenerational income mobility is lower in countries with high inequality, but research on trends in mobility finds conflicting results. Motivated by this uncertainty, we ask: how important are choices of specification for levels and trends in intergenerational income associations? We use Swedish data on cohorts born 1958--1977 and their parents. Varying how, when and for whom income is measured, we estimate 1,658,880 different associations (82,944 specifications across 20 cohorts). Our results reveal that model choice is an underrecognized source of variation in intergenerational mobility research. The most consistent contributor to trends is the advancement of women in the labor market, which leads to increased persistence in women’s earnings and the family income of both men and women. Depending on specification, it is possible to conclude that income mobility is increasing, decreasing, or remaining flat. Despite variability, our results are broadly consistent with the received view that the level of mobility in Sweden is high in a comparative perspective.

*Is Immigrant Optimism Contagious? Spillovers of Immigrant Friends in School* (with Are Skeie Hermansen)
| draft on request

<summary>Read more</summary>
Is academic achievement affected by the presence of immigrant peers? Previous work mostly suggests no but, we argue, has been misguided on two accounts. First, it focused on aggregate social settings such as schools, while social interactions unfold in more intimate settings. Secondly, it assumed that immigrant peers would harm performance, ignoring their often high aspirations. We use a combination of administrative and sociometric network data from Sweden, and develop methods that let us estimate causal effects of immigrant peers at the level of (i) schools, (ii) classrooms, and (iii) friendship networks. We find little influence at the aggregate level but a strong and positive impact of immigrant peers in the same classroom and of immigrant friends. Existing studies may have mistaken both the sign and the magnitude of immigrant influence.

*One School, Many Worlds: Within-School Sorting in Comprehensive and Tracked Systems* (with Isabel Raabe)
| draft on request
<details>
<summary>Read more</summary>
Why do inequalities in learning persist, even in relatively egalitarian school systems? We examine within-school ability sorting with classroom data on friendship networks in 480 European secondary schools. We contrast comprehensive (England, Sweden) and tracked systems (Germany, Netherlands) and ask how they shape sorting at the level of a) schools, b) classrooms, and c) friendships. Between-school variance in test scores is lower in comprehensive systems. However, this is counterbalanced by greater sorting within schools: between classrooms and, especially, friendship networks. Still, comprehensive schools create more equal environments for two reasons. First, the difference in sorting between schools is larger than that in sorting within schools. Second, the latter is less related to social and ethnic background. These findings help explain both why comprehensive schools equalize outcomes, and how substantial inequality can nevertheless remain. </details>
